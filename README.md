## Installation
The software needed to make sure this application runs is express 4.16.4, and uuid 9.0.1. Both of thses can be installed by running "npm i <name>@<edition>" into the intergrated terminal.

## Usage
After running ther server in the intergrated terminal with "node server.js" and opening the page on your browser, the User is able to write a title for the note and then the contents. The note will not be able to be saved until both the title and the contents have something written in them. The user can clear a note while writing it, save a note to the database so it will appear in the left column. The User can click on any of the notes in that column and it will display in the open note section, and the User can delete the note there if they'd like.
